# an-array-of-french-words

An array of ~210,000 French words. Works with Node and Browserify.

I found the list in this repo: https://github.com/ManiacDC/TypingAid. I'm not
sure of it's origin, but it's the most extensive French word list I could find.

## Programmatic Usage

To use the module in Javascript code, install it locally:

```sh
npm install an-array-of-french-words --save
```

Then:

```js
var words = require("an-array-of-french-words")
var funWords = words.filter(word => !!word.match(/^fun/i))
console.log(funWords)
```

## Command Line Usage

There's a CLI that prints all words to STDOUT. Install it globally:

```sh
npm i -g an-array-of-french-words
mots | grep toufle
```
